# Final-Project
A document and description of the Gaming Room

1.) The gaming room is a client looking for a system that can hold multipe players at one time acros the country for their game "Draw it or lose it". They require a system that can manage itself but is going to work well with all of its players and be easy to manage on its backend. They also have concerns with the price and security of the equipment being used.

2.) The best thing I did in my opinion was use my knowledge from the real world experience I have to best solve the gaming rooms problems.

3.) The design document helped me better understand how to put my thoughts together to solve problems for the company.

4.) I would choose the part about the systems being used on the network. My understanding of networks is rough and I would do more research on the subject, given more time.

5.) The best way to interpret your users needs is by putting yourself in their shoes. THis is important because the software is for them, not you. It must be made to work for them or they do not want it.

6.) In the future I would continue to do the same thing I am doing now. I will step back and write down everything /I need and attempt to make the bigger picture into a map to follow.
